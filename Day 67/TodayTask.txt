3.4: Phonebook backend step4
Implement functionality that makes it possible to delete a single phonebook entry by making an HTTP DELETE request to the unique URL of that phonebook entry.

Test that your functionality works with either Postman or the Visual Studio Code REST client.

3.5: Phonebook backend step5
Expand the backend so that new phonebook entries can be added by making HTTP POST requests to the address http://localhost:3001/api/persons.

Generate a new id for the phonebook entry with the Math.random function. Use a big enough range for your random values so that the likelihood of creating duplicate ids is small.

3.6: Phonebook backend step6
Implement error handling for creating new entries. The request is not allowed to succeed, if:

The name or number is missing
The name already exists in the phonebook
Respond to requests like these with the appropriate status code, and also send back information that explains the reason for the error, e.g.:

{ error: 'name must be unique' }
